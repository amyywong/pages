  <h1 id="WHO">WHO ARE WE</h1>
  <body id="body">
<p>The New School Art Gallery is an art gallery created to encourage aspiring artists at The New School to share their art with the world.
      <p>Every month a theme/topic will be presented and we encourage all students to submit one piece of their artwork inspired by that topic for it to be displayed.<p/>
        <p>There is limited space therefore not everyone will get a spot. The changing themes of the gallery will bring different knowledge and experiences into the room.</p>
        <p>This gallery strives to connect students, professors, tourists together to appreciate the creativity and talent we have at The New School.</p>
         <p>This is also an excellent opportunity for hidden talent to be discovered by the city. It is time for such talented artists to come out of hiding.</p>
         <p>This gallery welcomes all forms of visual art: paintings, drawings, sculptures, digital designs, photography, etc.
           Everyone is encouraged to join and help the community of young artists grow.<p/>
